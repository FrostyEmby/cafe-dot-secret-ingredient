I don't know if it's possible to add this guy, but I thought the egg mimic could be a crab disguised as an egg that you can collect and that peeks uot of its egg position sometimes. 
(so the animation plays on the egg, but there are big pauses.)
It would be the only egg that can be placed in a terrarium, which is the only correct choice.
If you put it in any medium temperature incubator, it eats an egg.
It doesn't like hot or cold incubators though and would wiggle around way more.
